 * Bitauth IDE.
 *
 * Returns an array of samples and an array of unmatched program states
 * remaining if `nodes` doesn't contain enough instructions to consume all
 * program states provided in `trace`. Returned samples are ordered by the
 * ending position (line and column) of their range.
 *
 * If all program states are consumed before the available nodes are exhausted,
 * the remaining nodes are ignored (the produced samples end at the last
 * instruction for which a program state exists). This usually occurs when an
 * error halts evaluation before the end of the script. (Note: if this occurs,
 * the final trace state will not be used, as it is expected to be the
 * duplicated final result produced by `vm.debug`, and should not be matched
 * with the next instruction. The returned `unmatchedStates` will have a length
 * of `0`.)
 *
 * This method allows for samples to be extracted from a single evaluation;
 * most applications should use
 * {@link extractEvaluationSamplesRecursive} instead.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This method incrementally concatenates the reduced bytecode from each node,
 * parsing the result into evaluation samples.
 *
 * Each node can contain only a portion of an instruction (like a long push
 * operation), or it can contain multiple instructions (like a long hex literal
 * representing a string of bytecode or an evaluation that is not wrapped by a
 * push).
 *
 * If a node contains only a portion of an instruction, the bytecode from
 * additional nodes are concatenated (and ranges merged) until an instruction
 * can be created. If any bytecode remains after a sample has been created, the
 * next sample begins in the same range. (For this reason, it's possible that
 * samples overlap.)
 *
 * If a node contains more than one instruction, the intermediate states
 * produced before the final state for that sample are saved to the sample's
 * `intermediateStates` array.
 *
 * If the program states in `trace` are exhausted before the final instruction
 * in a sample (usually caused by an evaluation error), the last instruction
 * with a matching program state is used for the sample (with its program
 * state), and the unmatched instructions are ignored. (This allows the "last
 * known state" to be displayed for the sample that caused evaluation to halt.)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * For example, the following script demonstrates many of these cases:
 *
 * `0x00 0x01 0xab01 0xcd9300 $(OP_3 <0x00> OP_SWAP OP_CAT) 0x010203`
 *
 * Which compiles to `0x0001ab01cd93000003010203`, disassembled:
 *
 * `OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_1 0xab OP_PUSHBYTES_1 0xcd OP_ADD OP_0 OP_0 OP_PUSHBYTES_3 0x010203`
 *
 * In the script, there are 6 top-level nodes (identified below within `[]`):
 *
 * `[0x00] [0x01] [0xab01] [0xcd9300] [$(OP_3 <0x00> OP_SWAP OP_CAT)] [0x010203]`
 *
 * These nodes together encode 7 instructions, some within a single node, and
 * some split between several nodes. Below we substitute the evaluation for its
 * result `0x0003` to group instructions by `[]`:
 *
 * `[0x00] [0x01 0xab][01 0xcd][93][00] [0x00][03 0x010203]`
 *
 * The "resolution" of samples is limited to the range of single nodes: nodes
 * cannot always be introspected to determine where contained instructions begin
 * and end. For example, it is ambiguous which portions of the evaluation are
 * responsible for the initial `0x00` and which are responsible for the `0x03`.
 *
 * For this reason, the range of each sample is limited to the range(s) of one
 * or more adjacent nodes. Samples may overlap in the range of a node that is
 * responsible for both ending a previous sample and beginning a new sample.
 * (Though, only 2 samples can overlap. If a node is responsible for more than 2
 * instructions, the second sample includes `internalStates` for instructions
 * that occur before the end of the second sample.)
 *
 * In this case, there are 6 samples identified below within `[]`, where each
 * `[` is closed by the closest following `]` (no nesting):
 *
 * `[0x00] [0x01 [0xab01] [0xcd9300]] [[$(OP_3 <0x00> OP_SWAP OP_CAT)] 0x010203]`
 *
 * The ranges for each sample (in terms of nodes) are as follows:
 * - Sample 1: node 1
 * - Sample 2: node 2 + node 3
 * - Sample 3: node 3 + node 4
 * - Sample 4: node 4
 * - Sample 5: node 5
 * - Sample 6: node 5 + node 6
 *
 * Note that the following samples overlap:
 * - Sample 2 and Sample 3
 * - Sample 3 and Sample 4
 * - Sample 5 and Sample 6
 *
 * Finally, note that Sample 4 will have one internal state produced by the
 * `OP_ADD` instruction. Sample 4 then ends with the `OP_0` (`0x00`) instruction
 * at the end of the `0xcd9300` node.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Note, this implementation relies on the expectation that `trace` begins with
 * the initial program state, contains a single program state per instruction,
 * and ends with the final program state (as produced by `vm.debug`). It also
 * expects the `bytecode` provided by nodes to be parsable by
 * {@link decodeAuthenticationInstructions}.
