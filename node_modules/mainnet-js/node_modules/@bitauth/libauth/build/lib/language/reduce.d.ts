 * Perform the standard verification of CashAssembly evaluation results. This

 * computing an evaluation, script compilation should fail.
 *
 * Three requirements are enforced:
 * - the evaluation may not produce an `error`
 * - the resulting stack must contain exactly 1 item
 * - the resulting execution stack must be empty (no missing `OP_ENDIF`s)
 *
 * This differs from the virtual machine's built-in `vm.verify` in that it is
 * often more lenient, for example, evaluations can succeed with an non-truthy
 * value on top of the stack.
 *
 * @param state - the final program state to verify
