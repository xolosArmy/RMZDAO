 *
 * @remarks
 * Notes from C++ implementation:
 * This function will compute what 8 5-bit values to XOR into the last 8 input
 * values, in order to make the checksum 0. These 8 values are packed together
 * in a single 40-bit integer. The higher bits correspond to earlier values.
 *
 * The input is interpreted as a list of coefficients of a polynomial over F
 * = GF(32), with an implicit 1 in front. If the input is [v0,v1,v2,v3,v4],
 * that polynomial is v(x) = 1*x^5 + v0*x^4 + v1*x^3 + v2*x^2 + v3*x + v4.
 * The implicit 1 guarantees that [v0,v1,v2,...] has a distinct checksum
 * from [0,v0,v1,v2,...].
 *
 * The output is a 40-bit integer whose 5-bit groups are the coefficients of
 * the remainder of v(x) mod g(x), where g(x) is the cashaddr generator, x^8
 * + [19]*x^7 + [3]*x^6 + [25]*x^5 + [11]*x^4 + [25]*x^3 + [3]*x^2 + [19]*x
 * + [1]. g(x) is chosen in such a way that the resulting code is a BCH
 * code, guaranteeing detection of up to 4 errors within a window of 1025
 * characters. Among the various possible BCH codes, one was selected to in
 * fact guarantee detection of up to 5 errors within a window of 160
 * characters and 6 errors within a window of 126 characters. In addition,
 * the code guarantee the detection of a burst of up to 8 errors.
 *
 * Note that the coefficients are elements of GF(32), here represented as
 * decimal numbers between []. In this finite field, addition is just XOR of
 * the corresponding numbers. For example, [27] + [13] = [27 ^ 13] = [22].
 * Multiplication is more complicated, and requires treating the bits of
 * values themselves as coefficients of a polynomial over a smaller field,
 * GF(2), and multiplying those polynomials mod a^5 + a^3 + 1. For example,
 * [5] * [26] = (a^2 + 1) * (a^4 + a^3 + a) = (a^4 + a^3 + a) * a^2 + (a^4 +
 * a^3 + a) = a^6 + a^5 + a^4 + a = a^3 + 1 (mod a^5 + a^3 + 1) = [9].
 *
 * During the course of the loop below, `c` contains the bit-packed
 * coefficients of the polynomial constructed from just the values of v that
 * were processed so far, mod g(x). In the above example, `c` initially
 * corresponds to 1 mod (x), and after processing 2 inputs of v, it
 * corresponds to x^2 + v0*x + v1 mod g(x). As 1 mod g(x) = 1, that is the
 * starting value for `c`.
